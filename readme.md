**Objective:** Add user authentication to your Microblog app by following today's <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/tree/master/week-04-associated-data-and-users/day-02/module-02" target="_blank">Auth Tutorial</a>.

## Getting Started

1. Make a **new branch** in your <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/express-microblog" target="_blank">express-microblog</a> called `auth`.
2. Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/tree/master/week-04-associated-data-and-users/day-02/module-02" target="_blank">Auth Tutorial</a> to implement user authentication. **A user should be able to:**
  * View a signup form
  * Sign up with a secure password
  * View a login form
  * Log in to the site
  * Log out of the site
  * View a profile page with dynamic information about their profile (this will just be `username` to start)

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Once you've finished the assignment and pushed your work to GitHub, make a pull request from **your `auth` branch** to the original repo.
